#### Abstract
At AppsFlyer we have been finding ourselves the victims of our own success, with our data continuously growing, alongside the capabilities we want to enable for our clients to make better marketing decisions. These, of course, eventually impact the technology we choose to make this all possible. This talk will dive into the evolution of our data management choices to support the changing needs of the business.

Powering more than 130 thousand mobile apps around the globe, AppsFlyer receives more than 70 billion requests a day, and as a result have a diversity of teams requiring real time performance for different use cases, whether real time attribution, monitoring, big data or web analytics. Each team has built their own technology stack to deliver on its needs. This talk will dive into the many different databases we use in-house – from Aerospike to Druid, Neo4J, Redis, to Clickhouse and even those we chose to eventually phase out. It will dive into the performance considerations for each, and the use cases we leverage each different database for, and why it’s the ideal DB for the job.

This talk will dive into our journey of how to choose the right solution for the job to implement real-time aggregation alongside batch processing over Apache Spark, and additional big data needs with Hadoop. Being able to evolve our architecture enabled us to solve recurring pains as well as aggregate 10X amounts of data with much faster response times, keep up with product demands while delivering a cheaper solution from a production cost perspective.
